# weather_image_classification
Hello and welcome to a new data science project, one that I'm excited to work on because it involves images! Yes, my friend, we are diving into image classification, specifically focusing on weather images.

The field of computer vision is rapidly expanding and finds applications in a variety of fields, from medicine to the military. Today, we're going to apply it to weather and classify images of different types of weather. In this project, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

1- Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
2- Develop and evaluate a multi-class classification model to identify the weather condition in each image.
3- Develop an API to serve the model, making it accessible for real-world applications.
